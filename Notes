Project Structure as is.

add .htaccess

-The app.php in the core folder acts as the router file. It routes all the urls provided in the browser.

Note: 
-I can add as many pages as we want as long we add a controller and a view for it. all preferrably with the same file name.

6. - Created a Controller in the core folder to host all common funtions.

7. -Every time a file is added in the core folder., it must be included in the init.php

After configuring the template.
-i create more controllers, i.e login, signup, upload 

Next.
-i create the views for the controllers.
